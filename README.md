## Overview

Brockbank et al. conducted an investigation of how well a counterfactual simulation model explains 
subjects' explanations of agents' behavior. We have replicated their computations and verified their 
findings regarding the performances of the counterfactual model and the simpler heuristic model, 
while attempting to develop a hybrid heuristic alternative that takes into account simple 
counterfactual assessments without commiting to a full simulation.

The results reveal that the hybrid model predicts subjects' preferences more accurately than both 
the simple heuristic and the counterfactual simulation models for trait judgments, and just as well 
as the heuristic for situation judgments, for which the researchers' model offers the best predictions. 

The hybrid model can be found in  
---->  \code\models\src\action_abstraction_models\hybrid_model.py,  
and the model comparison results are generated by  
---->  \code\analyses\model_comparison_hybrid.R.
