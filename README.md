## Overview

Brockbank et al. conducted an investigation of how well a counterfactual simulation model 
explains subjects' explanations of agents' behavior. We have replicated their computations and verified their findings
regarding the performances of the counterfactual model and the simpler heuristic model, while attempting
to develop a hybrid heuristic alternative that takes into account simple counterfactual assessments without commiting to a full simulation.
The results reveal that the hybrid model predicts subjects' preferences less accurately than both the simple heuristic and the counterfactual 
simulation models. 

The hybrid model can be found in \code\models\src\action_abstraction_models\hybrid_model, 
and the model comparison results are generated by \code\analyses\model_comparison_hybrid.
Please refer to the original authors' GitHub repo for the pipeline to reproduce the study.
